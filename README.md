Sportami utilizes the PERN stack to cover front-end, back-end and database management.

- On your preferred code editor, open the root project folder, i.e. the main `sportami` folder
  - duplicate the `.env.example` file located in `sportami/server`, then remove `.example` from its filename
    - in this newly-created `.env` file, provide the variables with relevant values
    - save your changes
- On your terminal, enter `psql`
  - then `\c sportami`
  - then `\i server/db/schema/create.sql`
  - and finally `\i server/db/seeds/allSeeds.sql`
- On your terminal, navigate to `sportami/server`
  - then `npm i`
  - then `npm start`
- On a **separate** terminal, navigate to `sportami/client`
  - then `npm i`
  - then `npm start`
- Keep the 2 terminals up and running
